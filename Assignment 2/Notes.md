# Structure

There is a folder for each topic with the following structure:

- visual studio, only contains visual studio files, intermediate compilation files and debug builds, I have set up the solution and projects to hopefully get in the way as little as possible.

- video log, contains the video logs and the scripts for each video, scripts are written poorly and contain hints and prompts to help me when recording videos, I didn't see any reason to remove them, however I suspect they are of little value for marking.

- source, contains the full source code of all applications created for the topic, these will be seperated into a directory per application.

- data, contains all data sources used in generating my reports, except for personal images which were used on some occasions.

- bin, the visual studio solutions are setup to output release builds here, I will leave a pre-compiled executable in the folder as well.
